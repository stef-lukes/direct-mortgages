          <h2>1. Protection</h2>
          <p>
            Protection is an important aspect which commonly gets overlooked –
            often for several reasons including:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Individuals believe that they will not need protection because
              they don’t believe it is necessary or the insured events “won’t
              happen to them”
            </li>
            <li>
              They believe it is too costly without realising how affordable
              cover can be obtained
            </li>
            <li>
              They do not understand the need for protection because its
              significance has not been explained adequately.
            </li>
            <li>
              Or simply, It is an unfavourable topic which is not easy or wished
              to be discussed
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Ultimately, protection is there to protect our assets, family &
            standard of living in the event of an accident either to yourself
            &/or your financial situation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Insurance policy pay outs may not always become materialised but if
            this is the case, above all else it will provide comfort knowing
            financial plans are in place in the event of an emergency & a
            financial burden won’t be inherited by yourself or family members.
            For instance, if you or your partner were to pass away or suffer a
            serious illness & your instant access savings or long-term savings
            (which may be subject to early withdrawal penalties) could not cover
            your expenditure, this is where insurance policies would become
            crucial to e.g.:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Cover mortgage payments if the event the one side of the mortgage
              paying income has been lost/ inhibited due to death/ illness
            </li>
            <li>Cover childcare / household maintenance costs</li>
            <li>Pay for funeral costs</li>
            <li>
              Pay for alterations to your home in the event of a permanent
              injury/ disability.
            </li>
            <li>Replace the deceased/ ill partners income</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Our protection policies can be adjusted to your needs & are
            available in 3 levels of cover to ensure bespoke protection:

            Increasing Cover: The level of cover increases over time generally

          <h2>2. Life Insurance</h2>
          <p>
            This can be a difficult subject to discuss at a premature time
            meaning it commonly gets overlooked but it is important to ensure
            your loved ones are protected during difficult times.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mortgage Life Insurance policies hold the main objective of paying
            off your mortgage in the event of death before the end of the
            mortgage term. In what will be an already distressing time, your
            family will have peace of mind that their home will not be
            repossessed by the mortgage lender. In simple terms, you pay into an
            insurance policy monthly, knowing it will pay out a sum of money to
            your family should you die within the term. Decreasing Life
            Insurance typically is used in conjunction with a repayment mortgage
            so the cover level reduces as you pay off your mortgage balance
            monthly. This tends to be cheaper than Level term policies whereby
            the sum assured remains fixed throughout the entire mortgage term,
            which can often be used to provide a surplus to paying off the
            mortgage e.g. to cover the family’s lifestyle etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            Term Insurance- Pays a fixed sum to family if you die within fixed
            term. Ceases when the arranged terms ends with no return of premiums
            e.g., May choose to insure yourself up until your children become
            financially independent which may be e.g. in 20 Years’ time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whole of Life Insurance- Pays a sum on your death, whenever this may
            occur. Due to the certainty of a pay-out at some stage, the sum
            assured is generally lower for the same premium vs a fixed term
            assurance policy.

          <h2>3. Critical Illness Cover</h2>
          <p>
            CIC is a policy which protects you on the diagnosis of serious or
            terminal illness which inhibits your ability to work. CIC policies
            cover a range of illnesses & diagnosis definitions which vary
            amongst insurers e.g., Alzheimers, Stroke, Cancer, Heart attack etc.
            It is important to ensure you are aware which conditions are covered
            under your policy i.e., some forms of cancer may be covered & others
            not.
          </p>
          <p>
            CIC is typically paid out as a lump sum payment although this can be
            adjusted to receive an income or both. A popular insurance strategy
            is to insure yourself for Life cover and CIC under one policy. This
            can be more cost effective & reliable since once you have a critical
            illness, it can then be a struggle to obtain subsequent life cover.
          </p>
          <p>
            The lump sum payment or income received from this policy could be
            used to repay a loan/mortgage or even make necessary alterations to
            your home to accommodate for your illness, amongst other reasons.

          <h2>4. Income Protection Insurance</h2>
          <p>
            IPI is designed to pay out a regular income, usually monthly, in the
            event you are unable to work due to sickness or disability.
            Depending on how you set up the policy, this income can continue up
            until you return to work or retire, therefore the policy is
            literally insuring, protecting & replacing your lost income.
          </p>
          <p>
            IPI is designed for employed & self-employed individuals. It should
            be highlighted that employed individuals who receive sick pay are
            likely to receive this for a maximum period of 12 months meaning
            ongoing protection after this is required. Meanwhile, for
            self-employed policyholders, sickness which hinders their ability to
            work will have an immediate effect on their income & therefore they
            will require their bills, mortgage payments etc, to be covered
            almost immediately so they may wish to opt for a short deferred
            period (Period of time which must elapse between onset of illness/
            disability & first pay out) to ensure they do not become too
            financially strained during this period.

          <h2>5. Accident, Sickness & Unemployment Insurance</h2>
          <p>
            ASU is a short-term protection policy which replaces your income for
            up to 12 months should you become unable to work due to an accident,
            sickness or involuntary unemployment. As with all insurance
            policies, it is about mitigating a financial burden should the
            insured circumstance occur. Whilst at the moment you may be fit &
            healthy, at any time anyone could fall sick & become unfit for work
            or be made redundant which subsequently inhibits your ability to
            earn income. ASU will provide 12 months of tax-free benefits to help
            you focus your efforts on getting fit for work/ finding another job
            rather than worrying over finances.

          <h2>6. Buildings & Contents Insurance</h2>
          <p>
            Buildings - When purchasing a property with a mortgage, the lender
            will always require that you arrange buildings insurance over the
            secured property & note the lenders interest on the insurance
            policy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Buildings insurance is put in place to cover the financial cost of
            repairing damage to the property’s physical construction in the
            event of theft or damage. This will include the roof, floors, walls
            & any permanent fixtures or fittings.
          </p>
          <p>
            Contents- The purpose of Contents Insurance is to cover the cost of
            replacing your in-home belongings should they become damaged, stolen
            or destroyed. “Contents” are generally referred to items which it
            would be reasonable to usually take with you should you move out of
            your home e.g., Furniture. Many people choose to also cover more
            expensive, listed items such as jewellery, art etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is common for Buildings & Contents insurance to be arranged under
            one policy rather than separately.
