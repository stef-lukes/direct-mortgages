          <h2>2. Re-Mortgage</h2>
          <p>
            A remortgage can refer to replacing your current mortgage
            arrangement with either a new deal with your existing lender or to a
            better deal with a different lender. Lenders consider remortgage
            applications in the same way as if you were applying for a new
            mortgage from scratch. Common reasons for remortgaging include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Reduce monthly mortgage payments: Take advantage of a better deal
              when your current “special period” ends e.g. 2 year Discounted
              rate comes to an end and reverts to the Standard Variable Rate
              (SVR). This means you could benefit from a new discount rate with
              a new lender or switch deals with your current lender.
            </li>
            <li>
              Release cash from your home: Release equity in your property in
              the form of a lump sum advance to pay for e.g. Other debts, home
              improvements etc. This is especially useful when your Property’s
              value has increased meaning you have gained more equity.
            </li>
            <li>
              Capitalise on competitive interest rate: Interest rates fluctuate
              so when they hit a low some wish to remortgage so they can switch
              to a better interest rate on their mortgage payments & save money

            Getting an acceptance first time does not guarantee the same on a

            originally got your mortgage which will adversely impact your credit
            score then lenders will not hesitate to reject the application. At
            Direct Mortgages, we work with specialist lenders to eliminate this
            stress & find you the best deal.

          <h2>3b. Buy To Let</h2>
          <p>
            A Buy to Let property, also known as an investment property, is
            purchased as a second property with the intention of letting it out
            to tenants rather than living in it as a residential property
            yourself. Becoming a Landlord has its perks but it is also very
            complicated & time consuming.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              BTL have higher min deposit typically 20-25% of prop val & also
              have higher interest rates on mortgages vs resi mortgages.
            </li>
            <li>
              Lenders usual main concern is the rental income yielded from the
              property, in some instances your own personal income is not even
              considered. Therefore, may be worth doing your homework e.g. via
              local lettings agent about the demand in that area, the estimated
              rental income etc of a property before you proceed with a purchase
              and mortgage.
            </li>
            <li>
              BTL rental income generally exceeds the monthly mortgage payments,
              leaving a surplus profit for the landlord but it is important to
              consider the other costs e.g.
            </li>
            <li>Property upkeep & maintenance</li>
            <li>Letting agent’s fees.</li>
            <li>
              Ground rent / service charges – applicable to leasehold
              properties.
            </li>
            <li>
              Legal insurance – to cover costs of evicting tenants in the event
              of non-payment, this can be very expensive.
            </li>
            <li>
              Insurance – building and contents insurance for the items provided
              under the tenancy agreement.
            </li>
            <li>Furnishings – If the let property is to be furnished.</li>
            <li>
              Gas / electrical appliances – cost of maintaining appliances and
              ensuring they comply with any regulations e.g. safety tests.
            </li>
            <li>Cost of decorating.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>3c. House of Multiple Occupancy</h2>
          <p>
            Also known as HMO is a popular method of maximising returns from one
            property. HMO’s require a license & involves multiple unrelated
            tenants residing in the same property on a room by room basis e.g.
            Student Housing.
          </p>
          <h2>3d. Serviced Accomodation</h2>
          <p>
            Similar to a HMO, this is a strategy of maximising returns from one
            property. Commonly marketed as accommodation on a night-by-night
            basis e.g. Bed & Breakfast, AirBnB etc
          </p>
          <h2>3e. Buy To Sell</h2>
          <p>
            Essentially buying a property as an investment to refurbish it as a
            project & then re-sell it at a premium, making a profit in the
            process
          </p>
          <h2>3f. Buy-Refurb-Finance</h2>
          <p>
            This involves buying a distressed property, possibly below market
            price, which would be considered un-mortgageable by residential
            lenders e.g. no functioning bathroom or kitchen, on an emergency
            bridge finance loan with the intention of refurbishing the property
            to an acceptable & habitable standard & then exiting the bridge loan
            with a standard term mortgage.

          <p>
            Getting on the property ladder as a first time buyer is not as easy
            as some may think. This is someone who is buying a house/flat and
            has not previously owned a property. They are usually more appealing
            to sellers as there is no chain involved, nor are they waiting to
            sell a property. Many lenders and builders will also offer
            attractive rates/deals to first time buyers as an incentive to buy
            and move onto the housing ladder. You would be also eligible for a
            95% loan (loan to value) or a help to buy guarantee government
            scheme. Many banks are now offering 95% LTV mortgages to first time
            buyers so you only need to put in 5% deposit.

            For many people, purchasing a house will be one of the most
            important financial decisions of their lifetime, this can be
            especially daunting for a first time buyer. In terms of a mortgage,
            with so many options available it can be difficult to make a
            decision that will not impact you finances too harshly, this is
            where we can help with our advice process. At Direct Mortgages we
            will guide you from the fact find to chasing solicitors, stamping
            out the stress & making the process as easy as possible.

            First Time Buyer with low credit? You have come to the right place.
            Whether you have had previous IVAs, CCJs, payday loans – we know the
            right lenders that will give you the consideration you deserve.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a first-time buyer, the advance a lender will be willing to offer
            you will be based on your household income & your affordability
            assessment when compared to other outgoings e.g. mortgage payments,
            utility bills, committed expenditure etc. There are ways to combat a
            low credit score to get the acceptance you need, such as increasing
            your deposit, & we can help advise you on this.

          <h2>5. Let To Buy</h2>
          <p>
            The term Let to Buy is used for someone who is letting their home
            in-order to buy a new home. This type of deal is very appealing to
            frustrated sellers who eventually decide to let their existing home
            and raise funds to buy a new home, all without feeling pressure to
            sell in a hurry and possibly at a loss. Such applicants can
            sometimes be referred to as accidental landlords since they may have
            struggled to sell their home & in the meantime, they are choosing to
            rent it out as a landlord which was not their original intention for
            the property. If you have enough equity in your property, you could
            re-mortgage and raise cash towards a deposit on a new property. Your
            existing property could then be let out to generate income, which in
            turn could cover the cost.

          <h2>6. Council Right To Buy</h2>
          <p>
            Introduced in the 1980s, the Council Right to Buy scheme is a
            popular government programme to help individuals living in council
            housing in England to get on to the property ladder & buy their
            council property at a discounted price. Different discount levels
            exist for houses & flats. To qualify for a right to buy purchase the
            following criteria must be applicable:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>It is your only property & it is in England</li>
            <li>
              You have lived in the council property for 3-5 years (Discount
              applied depends on length of time you have resided at the
              property)
            </li>
            <li>
              A legally binding contract exists between you & your landlord
            </li>
            <li>
              The property has had a public sector landlord for minimum 3 years
            </li>
            <li>
              It is a self-contained property i.e., there are no common areas or
              facilities which are shared with people outside your household.
            </li>
            <p>
              A Right to Buy Mortgage is similar to that of a standard mortgage
              in terms of affordability, income & expenditure, & in some cases
              you may be able to get one without having to put down a deposit
              since most lenders will treat the discount in the same way as
              this.

          <h2>8. Bridge Finance</h2>
          <p>
            This is a short term but affective lending option to provide
            funding, with speed being the most important factor. Bridging
            finance can be crucial in obtaining and facilitating a purchase or
            re-mortgage that otherwise could not happen when faced with time
            constraints. Bridge loans are ideal when you need money immediately
            for a short-term period. The most common use of these loans is to
            help fund a new property purchase, while waiting for your existing
            property to sell. Bridge loans are also commonly used to buy
            properties at auction where you need to move quickly and there is no
            time to delay. Once bridging finance is obtained, there is normally
            an exit strategy required to be put in place, this could either be
            the sale of the property or re-financing to pay off the bridge loan.
          </p>

            We can accommodate Bridging loans for low credit applicants with a
