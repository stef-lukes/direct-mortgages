            At Direct Mortgages, we understand your past should not influence
            your ability to move forward regarding your finances. Getting a
            mortgage nowadays can seem very automated, in the sense that if you
            don’t fit a lenders rigid criterion then you won’t get looked at
            twice.
          </p>
          <p>
            As specialists in the adverse credit mortgage field, we pride
            ourselves in sourcing mortgage finance solutions for those who have
            been rejected due to their past. We exist to get you the
            consideration & acceptance you deserve.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section id="repossessions">
          <h2>1. Repossessions</h2>
          <p>
            A mortgage is still possible after you have been repossessed,
            however it will be more difficult to obtain especially from
            well-known High Street lenders who are most likely to turn you away
            as soon as they become aware of this from your credit report.
            Repossession can be an extremely stressful and emotionally draining
            time, this can be made worse if you are haunted by this going
            forward by being constantly rejected for finance.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is why at Direct Mortgages we work with specialist lenders who
            are happy to look further into your current circumstances rather
            than immediately turning down an application. This makes the
            possibility of acquiring a mortgage after repossession more
            achievable. Lenders are likely to look at:
          </p>
          <p>
            -When you were repossessed<br />
            The reason for repossession<br />
            Alternative credit issues<br />
            Credit History & Performance since the repossession<br />
            Affordability
          </p>
          <p>
            The purpose of this is so a lender can understand if you have
            financially recovered from the repossession & to ensure a pattern
            has emerged which is likely to ensure you will not fall behind in
            repayments so an additional repossession can be avoided. If the
            lender is happy you have demonstrated a stable repayment pattern
            (serviceability) , your chances of getting a mortgage will be much
            greater.
          </p>
          <p>
            Remember: The better your serviceability, the more likely you are to
            be offered a mortgage at a more competitive rate!

          <h2>2.Pay Day Loans</h2>
          <p>
            Generally, lenders dislike the sight of payday loans on an applicant
            credit file because it indicates financial management struggles,
            which could occur again in the future if they were to grant you a
            mortgage, meaning you may find difficulty in servicing repayments.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mainstream lenders are likely to turn you down when they become
            aware of the use of a payday loan, even if it was many years ago. A
            payday loan will be viewable by a lender on your credit history for
            6 years. All lenders will have their own lending criteria regarding
            the use of payday loans, specialist lenders may be more lenient &
            therefore may be more inclined to consider an applicant who has took
            out a payday loan rather than immediately reject you.
          </p>
          <p>Such lenders will want to know:</p>
          <p>
            When the loan was took out<br />
            Amount borrowed<br />
            How often<br />
            How quickly loan was repaid
          </p>
          <p>
            A key determinant for whether a lender will be willing to consider
            the application is how long ago since the payday loan was taken out.
            The less recent it was, the more favourable a lender will consider
            you as an applicant.

          <h2>3. Zero Hour Contracts</h2>
          <p>
            Zero Hour Contracts refer to a method of employment where your
            employer doesn’t give you any fixed/ minimum working hours & you are
            not inclined to take any hour of employment offered i.e. you are
            free to accept or decline as many hours as you wish.
          </p>
          <p>
            This often means employees on a zero hour contract can’t show a
            regular full time income which, from a lenders point of view, may be
            an issue as it could indicate that repayment affordability could be
            hindered. If your monthly income fluctuates regularly, a lender may
            not feel confident that you will be financially stable to keep up
            with mortgage repayments. Regulation has ensured that lenders are
            much stricter & scrutinise an applicants earnings with evidence
            before a mortgage is granted & without a consistent level of
            earnings, this is likely to create an undesirable outcome for a
            mortgage applicant.
          </p>
          <p>
            Zero-hour contracts are becoming more common nowadays, to the point
            that specialist zero hour contract mortgage products exist,
            therefore specialist lenders exist to accommodate zero hour
            applicants. Therefore, the chances of obtaining a mortgage under
            these circumstances are better than in previous times.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are several ways zero-hour applicants can enhance their
            chances by displaying they are low risk candidates e.g.
          </p>
          <p>
            Offer a larger deposit if possible = means less funds have to be
            borrowed<br />
            Show employment history= if you have been in the same job for many
            years this shows that there is a degree of job security so earnings
            can continue in the future.<br />
            Show ALL Earnings e.g. Bank Savings, Investments, Rental income
            anything which can show your affordability is enhanced.
          </p>

          <h2>4. Low Income</h2>
          <p>
            Having low income is not necessarily an obstacle to getting a
            mortgage, the problem is when you need a mortgage that is not
            proportionate to your level of earnings. There are ways we can help
            you get around this if this applies to you, such as:
          </p>
          <p>
            Bringing another parties income on board as a joint application –
            this will mean a lender considers the combined level of income so
            they will interpret that since there are two incomes contributing to
            the mortgage, this will increase the affordability so a lender will
            be more willing to increase any potential loan advance
          </p>
          <p>Disclosing any savings, Investments or Rental Income</p>
          <p>
            There are ways to work around this so having low income does not
            make getting a mortgage impossible!

        <section id="no-proof-income">
          <h2>5. No Proof of Income</h2>
          <p>
            Although it is not straightforward, it is possible to get a mortgage
            without a proof of income! A lot of lenders lending criteria are
            geared towards incomes that follow a standard 9-5 job, ideally
            employed by a recognised organisation rather than self-employed.
