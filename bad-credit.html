            At Direct Mortgages, we understand your past should not influence
            your ability to move forward regarding your finances. Getting a
            mortgage nowadays can seem very automated, in the sense that if you
            don’t fit a lenders rigid criterion then you won’t get looked at
            twice.
          </p>
          <p>
            As specialists in the adverse credit mortgage field, we pride
            ourselves in sourcing mortgage finance solutions for those who have
            been rejected due to their past. We exist to get you the
            consideration & acceptance you deserve.
          </p>

        <section id="repossessions">
          <h2>1. Repossessions</h2>
          <p>
            A mortgage is still possible after you have been repossessed,
            however it will be more difficult to obtain especially from
            well-known High Street lenders who are most likely to turn you away
            as soon as they become aware of this from your credit report.
            Repossession can be an extremely stressful and emotionally draining
            time, this can be made worse if you are haunted by this going
            forward by being constantly rejected for finance.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is why at Direct Mortgages we work with specialist lenders who
            are happy to look further into your current circumstances rather
            than immediately turning down an application. This makes the
            possibility of acquiring a mortgage after repossession more
            achievable. Lenders are likely to look at:
          </p>
          <p>
            -When you were repossessed<br />
            The reason for repossession<br />
            Alternative credit issues<br />
            Credit History & Performance since the repossession<br />
            Affordability
          </p>
          <p>
            The purpose of this is so a lender can understand if you have
            financially recovered from the repossession & to ensure a pattern
            has emerged which is likely to ensure you will not fall behind in
            repayments so an additional repossession can be avoided. If the
            lender is happy you have demonstrated a stable repayment pattern
            (serviceability) , your chances of getting a mortgage will be much
            greater.
          </p>
          <p>
            Remember: The better your serviceability, the more likely you are to
            be offered a mortgage at a more competitive rate!

          <h2>2.Pay Day Loans</h2>
          <p>
            Generally, lenders dislike the sight of payday loans on an applicant
            credit file because it indicates financial management struggles,
            which could occur again in the future if they were to grant you a
            mortgage, meaning you may find difficulty in servicing repayments.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mainstream lenders are likely to turn you down when they become
            aware of the use of a payday loan, even if it was many years ago. A
            payday loan will be viewable by a lender on your credit history for
            6 years. All lenders will have their own lending criteria regarding
            the use of payday loans, specialist lenders may be more lenient &
            therefore may be more inclined to consider an applicant who has took
            out a payday loan rather than immediately reject you.
          </p>
          <p>Such lenders will want to know:</p>
          <p>
            When the loan was took out<br />
            Amount borrowed<br />
            How often<br />
            How quickly loan was repaid
          </p>
          <p>
            A key determinant for whether a lender will be willing to consider
            the application is how long ago since the payday loan was taken out.
            The less recent it was, the more favourable a lender will consider
            you as an applicant.

          <h2>3. Zero Hour Contracts</h2>
          <p>
            Zero Hour Contracts refer to a method of employment where your
            employer doesn’t give you any fixed/ minimum working hours & you are
            not inclined to take any hour of employment offered i.e. you are
            free to accept or decline as many hours as you wish.
          </p>
          <p>
            This often means employees on a zero hour contract can’t show a
            regular full time income which, from a lenders point of view, may be
            an issue as it could indicate that repayment affordability could be
            hindered. If your monthly income fluctuates regularly, a lender may
            not feel confident that you will be financially stable to keep up
            with mortgage repayments. Regulation has ensured that lenders are
            much stricter & scrutinise an applicants earnings with evidence
            before a mortgage is granted & without a consistent level of
            earnings, this is likely to create an undesirable outcome for a
            mortgage applicant.
          </p>
          <p>
            Zero-hour contracts are becoming more common nowadays, to the point
            that specialist zero hour contract mortgage products exist,
            therefore specialist lenders exist to accommodate zero hour
            applicants. Therefore, the chances of obtaining a mortgage under
            these circumstances are better than in previous times.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are several ways zero-hour applicants can enhance their
            chances by displaying they are low risk candidates e.g.
          </p>
          <p>
            Offer a larger deposit if possible = means less funds have to be
            borrowed<br />
            Show employment history= if you have been in the same job for many
            years this shows that there is a degree of job security so earnings
            can continue in the future.<br />
            Show ALL Earnings e.g. Bank Savings, Investments, Rental income
            anything which can show your affordability is enhanced.

          <p>
            Having low income is not necessarily an obstacle to getting a
            mortgage, the problem is when you need a mortgage that is not
            proportionate to your level of earnings. There are ways we can help
            you get around this if this applies to you, such as:
          </p>
          <p>
            Bringing another parties income on board as a joint application –
            this will mean a lender considers the combined level of income so
            they will interpret that since there are two incomes contributing to
            the mortgage, this will increase the affordability so a lender will
            be more willing to increase any potential loan advance
          </p>
          <p>Disclosing any savings, Investments or Rental Income</p>
          <p>
            There are ways to work around this so having low income does not
            make getting a mortgage impossible!

        <section id="no-proof-income">
          <h2>5. No Proof of Income</h2>
          <p>
            Although it is not straightforward, it is possible to get a mortgage
            without a proof of income! A lot of lenders lending criteria are
            geared towards incomes that follow a standard 9-5 job, ideally
            employed by a recognised organisation rather than self-employed.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have no proof of income, this will be a stumbling block. Many
            mainstream lenders wont consider the application and reject it at
            the first hurdle. This is because with no proof of income, a lender
            is walking in the dark if they were to offer you a mortgage as there
            is no indication of the applicant’s affordability.
          </p>
          <p>
            If this applies to you, it is recommended that you start to keep
            record of your declared income to help your ability to obtain
            finance in the future. In the meantime, we have access to specialist
            lenders who would be willing to assess your circumstances for
            lending.

          <h2>6. No Credit History</h2>
          <p>
            Having no credit history is not uncommon, potential reasons for this
            may include:
          </p>
          <p>
            Your name is not noted as a bill payer e.g. Live with parents/family
            such as a 1st time buyer.
          </p>
          <p>Recently moved to the UK or returned after a while away</p>
          <p>
            Don’t have a UK Bank account yet or credit card, utility bill,
            mobile phone bill, utilities etc
          </p>
          <p>No permanent address or not on electoral roll</p>
          <p>
            Outdated Credit History- A credit file record covers a 6 year period
            so borrowing over this period is visible on a credit report so if
            you have not borrowed in the last 6 years then this could mean you
            end up with no credit history e.g. Retired individual. If you have
            borrowed previous to this then your credit history can be proved
            manually.
          </p>
          <p>
            Without a credit history, lenders have no way to prove your ability
            to service your debts & whether you are good at meeting repayments.
            Lenders will carry out a credit check on an applicant which shows
            their credit file. This is often criticised as being de-humanising
            as it categorises individuals as undesirable applicants purely
            because they haven’t taken out a loan or credit card but this
            doesn’t always mean they are not able to service their debts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Often people don’t realise they actually do have a credit history
            e.g. through their phone contract. In the event that you have no
            credit history you can prove your financial capability:
          </p>
          <p>
            Find your employment records e.g. payslips, invoices, bank records
          </p>
          <p>Evidence of rent payments made on time</p>
          <p>Any bills in your name that have been paid on time</p>
          <p>
            These will help us build a profile of you as an applicant to
            demonstrate to the lender your financial management.

          <p>
            All lenders create a risk profile for applicants upon assessing

            interest rate should you be accepted for a mortgage or may not be
            able to borrow as much. As a result of this, you may have to make up
            any borrowing shortfall yourself e.g., through a larger deposit.

          <h2>8. IVA's</h2>
          <p>
            An Individual Voluntary Agreement represents a formal but legally
            binding agreement between yourself and your creditors over the
            arrangement of paying your debts back i.e. personal loans,
            overdrafts, credit card debts, HMRC liabilities etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            IVAs can only be arranged if at least 75% of your creditors agree to
            the arrangement. An IVA must be set up through an insolvency
            practitioner who will assess how much you owe & the necessary
            duration of the agreement to pay back your debts. You should not
            incur any upfront charges, but an insolvency practitioner will
            generally apply their own fees for their service- generally an IVA
            set up fee & a handling fee, both of which will be added to your
            monthly debt payments.
          </p>
          <p>
            Such Agreements generally allow you to pay off you debts over a
            specified period, this agreement will be enforced by the court so
            you & your creditors will have to stick to it. An IVA is useful
            because your creditors are not able to chase you for these debts any
            further since there is a court order, whilst creditors must also
            agree to freeze the interest on the amount owed so the debt wont
            build any further. This provides clarity on the amount to be repaid
            & when the entire debt will be settled.
          </p>
          <p>
            An IVA will show on your credit file & lenders generally don’t
            entertain IVA applicants, whether you remain in an IVA or have
            recently finished your IVA, since it signals previous credit issues
            in repaying your creditors. However, this does not mean that all
            lenders will deny an IVA applicant. We have access to Specialist
            lenders who will consider you & offer competitive rates to those who
            have previously finished or currently entered into an IVA.

            A CCJ is a County Court Judgement, which is a court order issued
            against you in England, Wales & Northern Ireland when you don’t
            repay money you owe to your creditors. This is generally a last
            resort in the event that a payment plan has not been followed or
            failed to be arranged. A CCJ issued against you means your name will
            be registered in the Register of Judgements, Orders & Fines. A CCJ
            will order that you pay off your debt either in instalments or a
            lump sum one off payment. A CCJ can be a dragged out process so it
            is unlikely that an individual is unaware they have been issued with
            a CCJ, normally you will have received several bill reminders,
            formal letters, creditor payment requests etc before a CCJ process
            is instigated.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since CCJs appear on your credit file, lenders tend to disapprove of
            such applicants. However, some lenders will review and accept you
            subject to the CCJ being repaid in full or even partially! Approval
            with a CCJ will rely on a few factors such as:
          </p>

            How recent the CCJ occurred<br />
            How many CCJS are on your credit file<br />

            Bankruptcy refers to the process of an insolvent individual
            declaring they can no longer make their repayments on their debts
            when they fall due. Once this process has begun, the bankrupts debts
            and assets are passed to an appointed insolvency practitioner/
            trustee in bankruptcy. The insolvency practitioner/ trustee will
            hold the authority to seize and sell the bankrupts assets in order
            to repay the bankrupts creditors. Bankruptcy lasts generally for 12
            months, in which time the bankrupts financial affairs are managed by
            the trustee. Bankruptcy can be voluntarily entered into if the
            individual believes they are unable to repay their debts, or it can
            be instigated by a creditor if they are owed more than £5,000.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whilst Bankrupt, the individual is referred to as undischarged. In
            this event, can only apply for nominal amount of credit – usually
            anything more than £500 will require you to voluntarily declare your
            bankruptcy. After the 12 months, the individual is now a discharged
            bankrupt whereby debts have been repaid & any remaining unsecured
            debts will be written off. However, even when discharged, the
            previous Bankruptcy can significantly affect your ability to obtain
            mortgage finance for the future. This will be declared on your
            credit file for 6 years & you will be required to disclose your
            previous bankruptcy to lenders. To improve your chances of being

          <h2>11. Defaults</h2>
          <p>
            A Default appears on your credit file when a creditor closes your
            account because you have missed payments, this will show up
            regardless of the amount owed even if this is a small amount owed on
            a phone bill! A Default will occur after missing payments for a
            period of 3 to 6 months, depending on the creditors default terms.
          </p>
          <p>
            The creditor will send you a default notice before closure of your
            account with the lender which acts as a request from them to remind
            you to bring your payments up to date withion a specified time frame
            (usually around 2 weeks). Default Notices are not visible on a
            credit report so if payments are made in accordance with a default
            notice you can be sure to avoid a default highlighted on your credit
            report.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lenders don’t treat all defaults the same. For instance, a mobile
            phone bill default will not be viewed with the same severity as a
            secured loan default. However, those with mortgage arrear defaults
            will know the struggle of obtaining mortgage finance or
            re-mortgaging once this is striked against their credit report,
            especially when this is in conjunction with other adverse credit
            issues like CCJs, IVAs or Bankruptcy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, the complexity of getting a mortgage with a default on your
            record depends on the type of default. Although it is an uphill
            battle, it is not impossible to get a mortgage under these
            circumstances & there are ways to improve your favourability as an

          <h2>12. Self Employed No Accounts</h2>
          <p>
            Mortgage lenders treat self-employed profits the equivalent as an
            employee’s earnings. Mortgage lenders want as much proof as possible
            to confirm that you earn what you claim you do so they can
            subsequently assess your affordability for borrowing purposes.
            Lenders have a duty to lend responsibly & therefore are cautious to
            strictly lend to those who are able to prove they can afford monthly
            repayments. They will want you to show them you have a steady &
            secure income which is going to project well into the term of the
            mortgage.
          </p>
          <p>
            After 1 year’s worth of accounts, most lenders will want to see your
            1st year tax return to assess your affordability. Generally, lenders
            will want 3 year’s worth of accounts as this gives a clearer
            indication of your earnings and how healthy your accounts are over a
            more sustained period, anything less than this lenders will not
            proceed with the same confidence in potentially granting a mortgage.
            Therefore, to have no accounts will prove to be a large obstacle in
            applying to lenders, especially mainstream ones. Specialist lenders
            exist who tailor their services in helping those in these
            circumstances, these are only available through brokers like

          <h2>13. Missed / Late Mortgage Payments</h2>
          <p>
            It is important to distinguish between late payments & missed
            payments:
          </p>
          <p>
            Late: The bill is paid but after it has fallen due, it is therefore
            recorded on your credit file as a late payment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Missed: The bill is yet to be paid. If left long enough or more than
            one payment is missed this can become a payment default.
          </p>
          <p>
            Arrears: When a sum of Money is owed, your account is described as
            being “in arrears”.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lenders will tend to view late/missed payments more seriously when
            these relate to secured loans e.g. Mortgages secured against
            property rather than unsecured e.g. credit card bills, personal
            loans.
          </p>
          <p>
            Creditors can only record a payment as late if the payment is
            outstanding for 30 days after it falls due. Many people
            unintentionally miss or are late to make payments, this is often
            understandable from a lender’s perspective. For example, if a
            payment is made 5 days late because you were not paid until 5 days
            after the bill was due then this wouldn’t be marked on your credit
            file as late.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is important to bear in mind that the more late/ missed payments
            you have on your credit file, the lower your credit score will be.
            Lenders will look at:
          </p>
          <p>
            How long ago these late payments were<br />
            If the payments were missed, were they settled & if so how long
            after<br />
            The payment amount that was late/missed
          </p>
          <p>
            If these factors are unfavourable, lenders may not proceed with your
            application or may offer you poor terms i.e. High Interest rates. If
            you are concerned about your late/ missed payments we can guide you
            to the right lenders who will not discriminate based on these.

          <h2>15. Low Deposit Schemes</h2>
          <p>
            Getting a mortgage with a low deposit is most definitely possible
            you just have to know which lenders to go to & who will offer the
            best rate… this is where we can help with our expert guidance from a
            skilled advisor! Bear in mind that rates tend to be MUCH higher if
            you've got less than 10% deposit, so if you can push for a 10%
            deposit then you'll get access to a cheaper mortgage. However, this
            is not always the case for everyone. Saving up for a deposit can be
            daunting, especially for a first-time buyer in a housing market
            where prices are on the rise & Property investors are buying out new
            entrants hoping to get on the property ladder.
          </p>
          <p>
            The minimum deposit you will need for a mortgage will be 5% in the
            UK, meaning at least 5% of the value or the property you wish to buy
            will need to be funded through your own personal funds, leaving you
            with a Loan to Value of 95%. Despite this being the minimum, not all
            lenders will offer such low deposit mortgage products.
          </p>
          <p>
            Low deposits leave buyers with few options but we can guide you
            according to your circumstances, these include:
          </p>
          <p>
            First Time Buyer: Many 95% Mortgage products are aimed at 1st time
            buyers as they tend to struggle with gathering the required sum of
            money to fund a larger deposit.
          </p>
          <p>
            Guarantor Mortgages: Some lenders will allow a family member to act
            as a guarantor, either in full or limited capacity, to cover the
            mortgage payments if you are unable to
          </p>
          <p>
            Gifted Deposit: These may come with higher rates, especially if they
            come from a 3rd party rather than a family member. The person
            gifting the deposit will need to complete a gifted letter to satisfy
            the lender they will have no interest in the purchase and it remains
            a non-refundable gift
          </p>
          <p>
            Assigned Savings: In place of a deposit, some lenders will allow a
            family member to place a sum of money in an assigned savings account
            with the lender which will accumulate interest & will be passed on
            to the lender in the event that you cannot keep up with your
            repayments.
          </p>
          <p>
            Right to Buy: This scheme allows tenants to purchase their council
            house at discounted value, often with a low deposit required.
          </p>
          <p>
            Concessionary Purchases / Gifted Equity: When you have purchased a
            property below market value, some lenders will allow the discounted
            equity sum to act as a deposit, e.g. A purchase at 10% below market
            value may be used to form a deposit with the lender since if the
            lender were to repossess & sell their security, this 10% could be
            reclaimed if sold at true market value.
          </p>
          <p>
            Government Scheme: The governments Mortgage schemes change
            regularly. At the moment
          </p>
          <p>
            Government Mortgage deposit scheme exists, extended till end of
            2023. Similar to previous Help to Buy schemes. Participating lenders
            must offer 5-year fixed mortgages as part of 95% LTV Products
          </p>
          <p>
            Not different from other 95% mortgage offers outside of this scheme,
            only difference is from lenders perspective, where government
            shoulders some of the cost if lender loses money above an 80% LTV
            threshold e.g. if borrower fails repayments, & repossessed property
            sale doesn’t cover outstanding mortgage amount then the lender can
            be essentially reimbursed any amount in excess of 80% of the LTV.
          </p>
          <p>
            To Qualify for the government backed scheme: Buy residential
            property (not 2nd or BTL), Property worth 600k or less, can’t be new
            build, deposit must be between 5-9%, mortgage on a repayment basis,
            pass lenders affordability criteria
